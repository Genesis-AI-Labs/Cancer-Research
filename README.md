# Geometric Manifold Generation to study Cancer and newly Emerging Diseases

## Project Description

Efficient generation of 3-Dimensional manifolds of internal organs from 2D-CAT Scans using Geometric Deep Learning to study and treat cancer, or newly emerging diseases without the risk of getting exposed to high frequency waves.

## Problem Statement:

MRI (magnetic resonance imagery) technology is very expensive in comparison to CT(computerized axial tomography) scans, but produces better results, knowing the fact CT scans are comparatively cheaper than MRI scans, producing results at better speed, reducing the time taken for diagnosis to initiate. CT scan lacks behind MRI due to the fact that some diseases remain undetected in CT scans eg; some types of cancer like Prostate cancer, uterine cancer, and certain liver cancers, are pretty much invisible or very hard to detect on a CT scan. Metastases to the bone and brain also show up better on an MRI scan, but costs more. Risk of getting cancer due to a CT scan is very minute, but radiationâ€™s effect adds up over your lifetime. So your risk increases with every CT scan you get

## Proposed Solution / Initial approach towards the Research:

To solve/rectify the issues stated in the problem statement above, The use of Deep learning based approach is being used. 

Generation of 3-Dimensional images/models from 2-Dimensional scans produced by a CT scanner, resulting in reduction of expense spent on a MRI scan which will help doctors to detect diseases which are harder to detect during a raw CT scan. 

Addition to the above solution, this will also facilitate Cancer detection for the patients with medical implants such as Bone-growth stimulants, Amantadine, Neurostimulants, Pacemakers etc, who are not allowed/debarred from getting a MRI scan due to high risks of fatal injuries and serious degree burns causing death and other diseases. 

As this is a very new/emerging field for research, implementation of a Anomaly detection using the similar advances in Deep learning based approaches and medical science will also help in detection of Newly occurring/Evolving and developing diseases which are not yet being discovered. Also as a repercussion of pandemic there is a lot of research that has been done on analysis of pathways of a disease and mutation, our research also focuses on generation of different possible mutations of a particular structure of a biological compound by manipulating random walks in graph structure of that compound.

## Requirements on Phase wise Research

### Phase-1 (Data Processing Phase)

Phase 1 of our research is particularly based on Data, in this process the main Ingredients are Processing, Segregation, Augmentation, Generation and Learning Geometric Prior of organs using 2D CAT images. 

Hence we require real world data of patients, we are also going to attach agreement of confidentiality and certification of research supervision from University. 

**Note**: *Contribution of data from institute will receive structured citation in Research paper*

### Phase-2 (Model Preparation and Training Phase)

Hardcoding of deep learning models to be done in Pytorch framework and to train heavy data based models requires computational cost, a lot of resources are supported from the university by itself, but other institutes can also support funding which is utilized by proper quotations.

### **Prediction of Mutation in new disease and their Potential Cure**

With the help of medical supervisors and a database of diseases, after the detection of new disease our architecture will help to supervise the mutation in the chemical composition of pathogen/ virus, with the help of graph machine learning we will try to simulate the effect of testing a potential drug on the virus and its mutation. 

Which will definitely help to reduce cost and wastage of resources in production of new drugs.

### **Medical Advancements and Outcomes of Research**

Following are the expected outcomes of our research proposal 

1. Better understanding of manifolds of the human abdominal region. 
2. Cost and time efficient solution to detect cancer. 
3. Easily applicable and robust model for application in rural sector. 
4. Precise generation of 3-Dimensional images of regions of interest.
